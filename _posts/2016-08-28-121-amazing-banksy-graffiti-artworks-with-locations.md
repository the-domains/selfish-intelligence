  Banksy is without doubt the world's most famous and celebrated graffiti
  artist. To some, his works of art are poignant, thought-provoking, ironic and
  humorous. To others, it is just plain vandalism. Whichever side of the fence
  you are on, there can be no doubt that he is a very talented and clever artist
  and conveys his views in a way that many of us could not manage to do.
